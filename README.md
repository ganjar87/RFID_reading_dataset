# RFID_reading_dataset

The dataset was collected using the RFID reader ALR-9900+ from Alien Technology and two linear antennas, ALR-9610-AL with 5.90 dbi Gain. 
The reader operates at a frequency of 902–928 MHz and supports EPC Class1 Gen2 (18000-6C). 
Passive RFID tags were attached to one side of each product box, using the model 9662 with a frequency range of 860‒960 MHz, IC type Alien H3 and EPC Class1 Gen2 (ISO 18000-6C) protocol. 

This dataset was gathered by considering various possible movements and directions of tags that can happen in real warehouse environments such as moving in and out through the gate, moving near the gate, turning back, and static tags (Please see the Figure below).
The setup used for this scenario was a single reader with two antennas, one installed outside and the other inside the warehouse gate. 
This allows for the recording of tagged products moving in and out of the warehouse.
